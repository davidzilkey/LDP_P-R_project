	abstract = {Ice provides a range of ecosystem services—including fish harvest1, cultural traditions2, transportation3, recreation4 and regulation of the hydrological cycle5—to more than half of the world’s 117 million lakes. One of the earliest observed impacts of climatic warming has been the loss of freshwater ice6, with corresponding climatic and ecological consequences7. However, while trends in ice cover phenology have been widely documented2,6,8,9, a comprehensive large-scale assessment of lake ice loss is absent. Here, using observations from 513 lakes around the Northern Hemisphere, we identify lakes vulnerable to ice-free winters. Our analyses reveal the importance of air temperature, lake depth, elevation and shoreline complexity in governing ice cover. We estimate that 14,800 lakes currently experience intermittent winter ice cover, increasing to 35,300 and 230,400 at 2 and 8 °C, respectively, and impacting up to 394 and 656 million people. Our study illustrates that an extensive loss of lake ice will occur within the next generation, stressing the importance of climate mitigation strategies to preserve ecosystem structure and function, as well as local winter cultural heritage.},

	abstract = {The impacts of climate variability and lake ice cover feedbacks on the seasonal thermal dynamics of inland lakes were evaluated for the period of 1916–2007. Analysis of regional scale impacts for the small inland lakes remains a major challenge in the Great Lakes region due to lack of observations at regional scale. Regional lakes were included into a land surface modeling perspective to understand the roles of climate variability on their open water season dynamics. The Variable Infiltration Capacity ({VIC}) model was applied with a physically based lake algorithm to simulate thermal conditions of lakes at regional scale during the open water period. Prior to its implementation, the {VIC} model was evaluated for lake surface water temperature in the selected lakes within the study domain. Results suggested that the cold (October–May) and spring (March–May) season air temperatures have increased by 1.38 and 1.54°C, respectively during the period of 1916–2007. Increase in air temperature was statistically significant at the regional scale. Onset of the stratified season has occurred earlier by more than five days during the period of 1916–2007. Earlier onset of the stratified season was significantly related to the length of the stratified season, thermal storage in the lakes, and mean lake surface water temperatures. The combined impacts of increased air temperature and earlier onset of the stratified season led to increased heat storage in lakes by 82.5×1016J. Degree-days above 15 and 20°C also increased by 97.5 and 33.0 degree-days during the period of 1916–2007. The lake ice cover was significantly related with the annual lake evaporation, timing of ice formation and break-up in lakes, and heat storage during the spring and summer. Results suggested the climate warming may lead to increased rate of evaporation that is driven by feedbacks of ice cover and snow storage.},

	abstract = {The formation and break-up of ice-cover are important seasonal events in mid- to high-latitude cold-region lakes. There is increasing concern regarding how climate change will affect lake-water thermal structure and lake-ice characteristics, particularly ice formation, duration, break-up, thickness, and composition. This study employs a one-dimensional process-based multi-year lake ice model, {MyLake}, to simulate the evolution of the Northern Hemisphere lake-ice and thermal structure patterns under a changing climate. After testing the model on Baker Lake located in Nunavut Canada, large-scale simulations were conducted over the major land masses of the Northern Hemisphere subarctic regions between 40° and 75°N using hypothetical lakes positioned at 2·5° latitude and longitude resolution. For the baseline period of 1960–1999, the lake-ice model was driven by gridded atmospheric forcings from the {ERA}-40 global reanalysis data set while atmospheric model forcings corresponding to future (2040–2079) climate were obtained by modifying the {ERA}-40 data according to the Canadian Global Climate Model projection based on the {SRES} A2 emissions scenario. Analysis of the modelling results indicates that lake-ice freeze-up timing will be delayed by 5–20 days and break-up will be advanced by approximately 10–30 days, thereby resulting in an overall decrease in lake-ice duration by about 15–50 days. Maximum lake-ice thickness will also be reduced by 10–50 cm. The change in maximum snow depth on the lake-ice ranges between − 15 to + 5 cm, while the change in white-ice thickness ranges between − 20 to + 10 cm depending on the geographic location and other climate parameters. The future warming will also result in an overall increase in lake-water temperature, with summer stratification starting earlier and extending later into the year.

	abstract = {Lake ice phenology has been recorded for decades, providing us with long-term records to investigate the impact of climate change in lakes since the Industrial Revolution. Here, we examine the trends and drivers of 18 lakes across the Northern Hemisphere, with 156–204 years of data, starting in the 1810s. We show that: (a) trends in ice phenology are faster than found by previous studies. Ice-on is 11 days later per century, ice-off is 9 days earlier per century, and ice cover duration is 19 days shorter per century; (b) there are significant breakpoints in the 1850s, 1870s, mid-1890s, and mid-1990s, after which trends in ice phenology are even faster, and associated with changing weather and climate; and (c) local air temperatures explain the most variation in ice phenology, on average 36.5\%, followed by progressive climate change explaining around 17.5\% on average, with teleconnection patterns explaining the least variation. Our findings support the assertion that broad-scale climatic changes have led to more rapid lake ice loss in lakes distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, with potential widespread impacts on critical ecosystem services that lake ice provides.},

Data are obtained from the State Climatologist. For Monona and Wingra, the freeze date (ice on) is defined as the first date on which the water body is observed to be completely ice covered, and the breakup date (ice off) is the date of the last breakup observed before the open water phase. Ice duration is the number of days that a water body is completely covered with ice and excludes any period during which the lake thawed in mid-winter before freezing again. For Mendota, duration is calculated in the same manner, but ice on and ice off dates are assigned as follows: the lake is deemed frozen if it has solid ice from Picnic Point to Maple Bluff, and total ice cover is greater than 50 \%. The lake is deemed open if it is ice-free from Picnic Point to Maple Bluff and total ice cover is less than 50\%. Sampling Frequency: annually. Number of sites: 3.},
