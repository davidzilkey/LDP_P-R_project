## Abstract

This is a test citation to see if I can figure out how it works [@mishra_changing_2011]. Looks like it does! Although,
for some reason, I don't see a dropdown menu to select the citation when I type @ followed by the author name. Will
need to figure out why this is in post-doc office hours. Here are two more citations, just for kicks: @dibike_response_2011, @sharma_widespread_2019. 

## Introduction

## Materials and Methods

## Results

## Discussion

## Conclusion
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
